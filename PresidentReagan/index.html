					<p>Ronald Reagan, known as the Great Communicator, was a president with a great personality and character. Reagan began his long life
					as a sports announcer, became the president of the Screen Actors Guild, Governor for California (yeah, just as Schwarzenegger)
					and finally  the President of the United States of America. </p>
					
					<p> Ronald Reagan lead his administration through conservative values, better relations with the Soviet Union,
					and with his own style of economics, Reaganomics, 
					which involved the cut of budget, the cut of taxes, and a bigger support to the country's defense. 
					</p>
					
					<p> Other accomplishments of Ronald Reagan involve the creation of the Strategic Defense Initiative, which
					was a system that could stop incoming missiles (Star Wars is the real name of the system). Reagan became good
					friends of Mikhail Gorbachev (Gorby), and created a better diplomacy through Perestroika (Path to capitalism).
